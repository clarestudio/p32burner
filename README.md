# pic32icsp

This is a very tiny, low-cost tool to program flash memory of
the Microchip PIC32MX2xx series MCUs via 2-wire ICSP protocol.

You can eliminate buying PICkit or similar costly vendor tools for PIC32MX210/220/230/250.
You can program the microcontroller from the NetBSD, other than Linux and/or Windows.

## Status

This is still in an experimental project,
there is no compatibility plan(s) between versions.

Since the software was written first, the head version has not been verified.

## Target Host OS

* NetBSD/amd64 and/or other little endian, 64bit architecture
* GNU/Linux, little endian, 64bit architecture

## Target Devices

* PIC32MX210 (PIC32MX210F016B)
* PIC32MX220 (PIC32MX220F032B)
* PIC32MX230 (PIC32MX230F064B)
* PIC32MX250 (PIC32MX250F128B)

PIC32MX270 was planned, but not yet done.

## Bill of Materials

* Atmel/Microchip ATtiny2313 microcontroller
* 9.216MHz quartz crystal timing device
* two 22pF ceramic capacitors for quartz crystal
* some 0.1uF ceramic capacitors for bypassing of power rail
* 3.3V LDO voltage regulator device and reasonable bypass capacitors
* 3.3V I/O compatible USB-UART module
* your favorite connectors and wires
* your favorite universal board
* your favorite PIC32MX2xx device as a target

## Hardware wirings

* pin 20 (Vcc) -- 3.3V power supply
* pin 10 (GND) -- common ground
* pin 2 (RxD) -- upstream serial port (connect to the USB UART module)
* pin 3 (TxD) -- upstream serial port (connect to the USB UART module)
* pin 4 (XTAL2) -- connect quartz crystal and a load capacitor (may be 22pF)
* pin 5 (XTAL1) -- connect quartz crystal and a load capacitor (may be 22pF)
* pin 14 (PB2) -- MCLR# of the target PIC32MX
* pin 13 (PB1) -- PGEC of the target PIC32MX
* pin 12 (PB0) -- PGED of the target PIC32MX

## How to build firmware

To obtain the firmware binary image,
you need gmake, avr-binutils, avr-gcc, and avr-libc.
Adjust Makefiles and run (g)make.

Suggested fuse bits for ATtiny2313:
* efuse = 0xFF
* hfuse = 0xDF
* lfuse = 0x6F

## How to build host program

To obtain the host program binary, you need gmake and gcc.
Adjust Makefiles and run (g)make.

The versions of the controller and host programs should be matched.

## How to use

To write a program file "target.hex" via host serial port "ttyUSB01":

./pic32icsp -d /dev/ttyUSB01 -w target.hex
